You can keep some or just delete them and create
 yours with `npm run dev -- create`.

 The syntax is pure [Open API](https://www.openapis.org/),
 the types are automatically generated with the `npm run watch`

For it to work, you have to export the definition, like
 here, to make it available for the API service, responsible

The handler implementation is here, you can notice
 the Input/Ouput types that were automatically generated
 to help you keep definitions and code in sync.

Handlers implementations take dependencies as the first
 argument and parameters in the second.

Dependencies are injected by Whook on-demand based
 on their name.

Parameters are cleaned up and checked by Whook so
 that you just have to use the values according
 to the API contract you set in the handler's
 Open API definition above.

/* Architecture Note #3.2.2: Exportation

Here we simply tag the handler function as
 an handler Whook's will be able to use.

There is some magic here with the use of
 dependency injection with `Knifecycle`.

 [here](https://github.com/nfroidure/knifecycle).
