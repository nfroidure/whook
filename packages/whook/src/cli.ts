/* Architecture Note #4: Commands

Whook's commands are CLI tools that you may need to create and
 use with your Whook's projects.

By doing so, it provides you a convenient way to reuse your
Whook's project configuration, services and handlers easily
 in you day to day command line programs.

To test this project, go to a project (in this repo
 `@whook/example`) and run:

```sh
cd packages/whook
npm run build
cd ../whook-example

# Debugging compiled commands
node ../whook/bin/whook.js ls

# Debugging source commands
npm run cli -- tsx ../whook/bin/whook.js ls
```
