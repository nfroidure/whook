## 1. Server run

Whook exposes a `runServer` function to programmatically spawn
 its server. It is intended to be reusable and injectable so
 that projects can override the whole `whook` default behavior.

[See in context](./src/index.ts#L207-L211)



## 2. Server preparation

Whook exposes a `prepareServer` function to create its server
 configuration. It takes eventually additional injections that
 would be required at a higher level and a
 [Knifecycle](https://github.com/nfroidure/knifecycle)
 containing the bootstrapped environment and allowing
 to complete and run the server.

[See in context](./src/index.ts#L290-L297)



### 2.1. Root injections

* We need to inject `httpServer` and `process` to bring life to our
 *  server. We also inject `log` for logging purpose and custom other
 *  injected name that were required upfront.

[See in context](./src/index.ts#L311-L315)



## 3. Server environment

The Whook `prepareEnvironment` function aims to provide the complete
 server environment without effectively planning its run. It allows
 to use that environment for CLI or build purposes. It also
 provides a chance to override some services/constants
 before actually preparing the server.

[See in context](./src/index.ts#L325-L331)



### 3.1. `PWD` env var

The Whook server heavily rely on the process working directory
 to dynamically load contents. We are making it available to
 the DI system as a constant.

[See in context](./src/index.ts#L342-L346)



### 3.2. `NODE_ENV`/`APP_ENV` env var

Whook has different behaviors depending on their values.
 Consider setting it to production before shipping.

[See in context](./src/index.ts#L356-L359)



### 3.3. `WHOOK_PLUGINS` and `PROJECT_SRC`

Whook need to know where to look up for things like
 commands / handlers etc...

[See in context](./src/index.ts#L361-L364)



### 3.4. Logging

Whook's default logger write to the NodeJS default console
   except for debugging messages where it uses the `debug`
   module so that you can set the `DEBUG` environment
   variable to `whook` and get debug messages in output.

[See in context](./src/services/logger.ts#L6-L11)



### 3.5. Initializers

Whook's embed a few default initializers proxied from
 `common-services`, `@whook/http-router` or its own
 `src/services` folder. It can be wrapped or overriden,
 at will, later in project's main file.

[See in context](./src/index.ts#L378-L383)



## 4. Commands preparation

Whook expose `prepareCommand` function to create commands configuration
before effectively running them

[See in context](./src/index.ts#L415-L418)



## 5. Base URL

The `BASE_URL` service is intended to provide a base URL where
 the API can be found at. It can be overriden directly via
 injecting it but it is useful to have a usable URL while
 debugging production environnement.

[See in context](./src/services/BASE_URL.ts#L5-L10)



### 5.1. Configuration auto loading

Loading the configuration files is done according to the `APP_ENV`
   environment variable. It basically requires a configuration hash
   where the keys are Knifecycle constants.

  Let's load the configuration files as a convenient way
   to create constants on the fly

[See in context](./src/index.ts#L402-L409)



### 5.2. Wrappers auto loading support

We inject the `HANDLERS_WRAPPERS` in the `WRAPPERS`
 service so that they can be dynamically applied.

[See in context](./src/services/_autoload.ts#L202-L205)



#### 5.2.1. Injecting handlers

A good thing is that you can reuse any handler into
   your commands by simply injecting it by name.

[See in context](./src/commands/generateOpenAPISchema.ts#L38-L42)



### 5.3. API auto loading

We cannot inject the `API` in the auto loader since
 it is dynamically loaded so doing this during the auto
 loader initialization.

[See in context](./src/services/_autoload.ts#L117-L121)



### 5.3. Examples

Whook's default project comes with a few sample commands.

[See in context](./src/commands/generateOpenAPITypes.ts#L11-L14)



#### 5.3.1. Typings generator

This command allows you to generate the API types that
 helps you to write your handler in a clean and safe
 manner.

[See in context](./src/commands/generateOpenAPITypes.ts#L16-L21)



#### 5.3.2. Open API generator

Here, we reuse the Open API handler to generate the
 definition of the API right inside a CLI command.

[See in context](./src/commands/generateOpenAPISchema.ts#L8-L12)



### 5.4. Constants

First of all the autoloader looks for constants in the
 previously loaded `APP_CONFIG` configurations hash.

[See in context](./src/services/_autoload.ts#L163-L166)



### 5.4. Testing

In such a hard life, Whook's make it simple to
 also test your commands.

[See in context](./src/commands/generateOpenAPISchema.test.ts#L6-L10)



### 5.5. Handlers map

Here, we build the handlers map needed by the router by injecting every
 handler required by the API.

[See in context](./src/services/_autoload.ts#L181-L184)



### 5.6. Service name mapping

In order to be able to easily substitute a service per another
 one can specify a mapping between a service and its substitution.

[See in context](./src/services/_autoload.ts#L148-L151)



#### 5.6.1. WhookInitializerMap

Whook exports a `WhookInitializerMap` type to help you ensure yours are valid.

[See in context](./src/services/_autoload.ts#L39-L41)



### 5.7. Service/handler/wrapper loading

Finally, we either load the handler/service/wrapper module
 if none of the previous strategies applied.

[See in context](./src/services/_autoload.ts#L215-L218)



#### 5.7.1. WhookServiceMap

Whook exports a `WhookServiceMap` type to help you ensure yours are valid.

[See in context](./src/services/_autoload.ts#L34-L36)



#### 5.7.1. Initializer path mapping

In order to be able to load a service from a given path map
 one can directly specify a path to use for its resolution.

[See in context](./src/services/_autoload.ts#L221-L224)



#### 5.7.2. Plugins/project paths

Trying to load services from plugins/project paths.

[See in context](./src/services/_autoload.ts#L235-L237)



## 6. `$autoload` service

The default Whook autoloader provides a simple way to
 load the constants, services and handlers of a Whook
 project automatically from the installed whook plugins.

[See in context](./src/services/_autoload.ts#L61-L65)



## 7. IP detection

If no `HOST` configuration is specified in dependencies nor in ENV,
 this service detects the machine host automagically.

[See in context](./src/services/HOST.ts#L7-L10)



## 8. Plugins resolution

Whook auto loader can look for initializers in a list of
 plugins defined in the `WHOOK_PLUGINS` constant. This
 service checks their existence and computes once for all
 the details needed by the framework (to find services/handlers
 it provides).

[See in context](./src/services/WHOOK_RESOLVED_PLUGINS.ts#L7-L14)



## 9. Port detection

If no `PORT` configuration is specified in dependencies nor in ENV,
this service detects a free port automagically.

[See in context](./src/services/PORT.ts#L9-L12)



## 10. Commands

Whook's commands are CLI tools that you may need to create and
 use with your Whook's projects.

By doing so, it provides you a convenient way to reuse your
Whook's project configuration, services and handlers easily
 in you day to day command line programs.

To test this project, go to a project (in this repo
 `@whook/example`) and run:

```sh
cd packages/whook
npm run build
cd ../whook-example

# Debugging compiled commands
node ../whook/bin/whook.js ls

# Debugging source commands
npm run cli -- tsx ../whook/bin/whook.js ls
```

[See in context](./src/cli.ts#L11-L35)



## 11. API definitions loader

The `API_DEFINITIONS` service provide a convenient way to
 gather your various API definitions from the handlers you
 created in the `src/handlers` folder.

[See in context](./src/services/API_DEFINITIONS.ts#L27-L31)
