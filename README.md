Why write code when you have an OpenAPI 3 definition?

![The Whook's logo](./whook.svg)

## Summary

Whook eats your documentation and provides you with a performant router that
take care of running the right code for the right operation.

By using the [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) standard and the dependency
injection pattern, Whook provides a convenient, highly modular and easily
testable back end framework.

## Quickstart

To start a new Whook project:

```sh
# Initialize the project
npm init @whook;
cd my_project_name;

# Check install with a dry run of the server
DRY_RUN=1 npm run start

# Run tests
npm t

# Start developping
npm run watch

# Build the project
npm run build

# Create a new handler/service/provider
npx whook create
```

## Why use Whook?

- robust: types, functional programming
- highly modular, extendable and reusable
- fully integrated and production ready
- easy to deploy, anywhere (serverless, docker, microservices): enter the
  anylith era
- easy to test: TDD, E2E tests made easy
- feature complete for most API use cases
- simplify your life but embrace projects complexity

## Usage

A tutorial is still to be written, expect it to come very soon. The above
[quickstart command](#quickstart) is a good starting point.

That said you can check the following "How to" PRs:

- [add GraphQL](https://github.com/nfroidure/whook/pull/62)
- [deploy on AWS Lambda](https://github.com/nfroidure/whook/pull/54)
- [deploy with GCP Cloud Functions](https://github.com/nfroidure/whook/pull/66)

Also, the [`packages/` folder](./packages) contains a lot of easy to setup
modules with well detailed readmes and setup instructions.

Finally, search for Whook's package easily with the
[NPM's Whook tag](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:whook). Also the
[Knifecycle tag](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:knifecycle) can be
useful to find projects using the same dependency injection framework.

If you have any question or issue using Whook, post your help request to stack
overflow with the
[Whook tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=whook). Questions with
this tag will be regularly checked by Whook's authors.

Finally, if you encounter any bug (unexpecter error, feature requests, OpenAPI
specification violation), please fill an issue!

## Principles

[Check this deck](https://slides.com/nfroidure/introducing-whook) for a complete
introduction to Whook's principles!

### Global overview

This projects aims to make creating well documented and highly customizable REST
APIs a breeze. It is the final outcome of my experience
[building REST APIs with NodeJS](https://insertafter.com/en/blog/http_rest_apis_with_nodejs.html).

By relying on the [OpenAPI format](https://www.openapis.org/) to declare a new
endpoint, this project forces documentation before code. It also is highly
customizable since based on the dependency injection with inversion of control
pattern allowing you to override or wrap its main constituents.

![Architecture Overview](./overview.svg)

The Whook route handling flow is very simple.

First, we have a HTTPServer that handles requests and serve responses (the
`httpServer` service).

Then, the `httpTransaction` transform the NodeJS requests into raw serializable
ones (raw objects with no methods nor internal states, useful for testing).

Then the router (`httpRouter`) deal with that request to test which handler need
to be run by comparing the method/path couple with the OpenAPI operations
declarations.

Once found, it simply runs the right handler with the OpenAPI parameters value
filled from the serializable request. The handler simply have to return a
serializable response object in turn.

If any error occurs within this process, than the `errorHandler` is responsible
for providing the now lacking response object based on the error it catches.

And that's it, you have your REST API. We have
[no middleware](http://insertafter.com/en/blog/no_more_middlewares.html) concept
here. Instead, every handler is a simple function taking an object and returning
another one. It makes those objects very easily composable (in a functional
programming sense).

You may add global wrappers to change every handlers input/output on the fly or
add a local wrapper specifically to one of a few handlers.

### Core concepts

Whook work by adding ingredients to you API:

- **configuration**: Whook look ups for `config/{NODE_ENV}/config.js` files. It
  creates constants you can inject in your handlers and services.
- **API**: It defines the various endpoint of you API and how to map these to
  handlers thanks to the well known OpenAPI format (formerly Swagger),
- **handlers**: the code that implement the API endpoints,
- **services**: various services that deal with side effects,
- **wrappers**: higher order functions you can apply to handlers (CORS
  authentication...).

You can see a lot of those concepts implemented in the
[Whook example](./packages/whook-example) folder.

Whook's DI system relies on the
[Knifecyle](https://github.com/nfroidure/knifecycle) module. It is great for
adding or easily override/wrap a lot of its core component and brings
instrumentation and testability to your code bases.

## Contributing

Contributors are very welcome to help pushing Whook forward!

Clone this project's repository and run:

```sh
npm i
npm run build
npm run metapak
npm t
```

The repository is based on LernaJS that allows to host several NPM packages in a
single repository. That said, to keep it simple it only proxies the packages
commands.

Install those
[VSCode extensions](https://insertafter.com/en/blog/my_vscode_configuration.html)
to get a smooth developer experience.

For commiting run:

```sh
npm run cz
```

## Publishing

```sh
NODE_ENV=cli npm run lerna  -- publish
```
